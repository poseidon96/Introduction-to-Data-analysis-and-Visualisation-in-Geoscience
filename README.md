# Introduction-to-Data-analysis-and-Visualisation-in-Geosciences (Oceanography and Meteorology)
* This is the prototype for a tutorial project in analysis and visualisation of Oceanographic &amp; Meteorological data.<br/>
* The only prerequisite for this tutorial will be some basic working knowledge in oceanography or meteorology.<br/>
## Working with Oceanographic Data
A broad range of [oceanographic data](http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/tn404/text/tn404_7.html) is available today, a manifold increase in data generation compells the oceanography students to be equipped with the latest and most potent analysis tools. From general purpose programming languages to those which are tailored to the Ocean/Met community, we are at liberty to chose.<br/>
In this tutorial we will try our best to pool resources scattered around to make your life a little bit better.
### Common programming languages used in Oceanography
* [Ferret](https://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/) (Custom tailored for Ocean/Met Data)
* [CDO](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/) (Climate data operator)
* [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/)(NCAR Command Language)
* [GMT](http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/)(Generic Mapping Tools)
* Panoply
* Octave
* Matlab
* Python
